# Communicate-Data-Findings
## Project overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part,I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset.
